<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>
    There are some contexts in which you want to be able to rate limit &xep0045;
    messages. This could have multiple motivations: avoid flooding, garantee
    a better readability of the room when there are hundreds of active users, â€¦
  </p>
  <p>
    This specification propose a new option to MUC rooms, allowing room owners
    to fix a duration that users MUST wait between two messages.
    We will also specify how the server MUST reject messages send too quickly,
    and how clients SHOULD handle this feature (by preventing users to send
    messages without waiting the delay to be over, and displaying some
    information to them).
  </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <p>This document addresses the following requirements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      How to allow room owners to enable and configure the feature by editing
      the MUC room discovery information.
    </li>
    <li>
      How to enable and configure the feature without allowing room owners to
      change the configuration.
    </li>
    <li>
      How the server MUST reject messages that does not respect the parameters.
    </li>
    <li>
      How clients SHOULD handle rooms with such feature enabled.

<section1 topic='Use Cases' anchor='usecases'>
  <p>
    The MUC Slow Mode can for example be used when a MUC room is associated
    to a live video stream. In such case, there are often hundreds of people
    writing at the same time. To avoid flooding, and encourage participants to
    post relevant messages, slow mode can be usefull.
  </p>

  <section2 topic="Activating Slow Mode in the MUC Room configuration" anchor="muc-configuration-activation">
    <p>
      Your implementation MAY allow the Slow Mode feature to be set room by
      room, by their owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      If room owners can configure the Slow Mode feature, the server MUST add a
      <tt>'muc#roomconfig_slow_mode_duration'</tt> field in the room
      configuration form.
    </p>
    <p>
      This field MUST have its type equal to <tt>'text-single'</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This field MUST use
      <link url="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0122.html">
        Data Forms Validation
      </link>, having its datatype equal to <tt>'xs:integer'</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <tt>'value'</tt> of the field MUST be a positive integer, so you MUST
      add a <tt>'range'</tt> validation, as described in &xep0122;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Value <tt>'0'</tt> means that the slow mode is disabled for this room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any positive value is the duration, in seconds, users must wait between
      two messages.
    </p>

      Here is an example of response the server could send when a client is

      The feature can be enabled on a room:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        by the room owner, if your implementation allow them to set this option,
      </li>
      <li>by a server-wide parameter,</li>
      <li>by any other criteria, specific to the room or not.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In other words: you can enable this feature, without adding the field in
      the room configuration form. This allows for example server admins to
      apply a rate limit server-wide, or to set the slow mode programmatically
      on any wanted criteria (number of users in the room, current server load,
      room context, ...).
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, to allow clients to discover that the feature is active, the
      server MUST respond on
      <link url="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html#disco-roominfo">
        room information queries
      </link>
      by adding a <tt>'muc#roominfo_slow_mode_duration'</tt> field.
      This field type MUST be <tt>'text-single'</tt>, and its value MUST be a
      positive integer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Value <tt>'0'</tt> means that the slow mode is disabled for this room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any positive value is the duration, in seconds, users must wait between
      two messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any invalid (non-positive integer) value sent by the server MUST be
      considered as equal to <tt>'0'</tt> (in case of a bad implementation).

    If the slow mode duration has changed (either because the room configuration
    was modified, or because a server parameter has changed, or any other
    reason), the server SHOULD send a status code <tt>'104'</tt>, as specified
    in <link url="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html#roomconfig-notify">

<section1 topic="Server-side rate limiting" anchor="server-side-rate-limiting">
  <p>
    When the Slow Mode is enabled, server MUST NOT accept two consecutive
    messages from the same user, to the same room, until the slow mode duration
    has elapsed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only messages containing at least one <tt>'&lt;body/&gt;'</tt> element must
    be taking into account (to avoid counting <tt>'chatstate'</tt> messages for
    example).
  </p>
  <p>
    Room administrators and owners MUST NOT be rate limited.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a user bypass the limit, the server MUST reply an error stanza, that
    respects &rfc6120; stanza erors (see
    <link url="https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6120.html#stanzas-error">
    RFC6120 - stanza errors</link>), to reject the message. Especially:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <tt>'error_type'</tt> MUST be <tt>'wait'</tt>, as described in
      <link url="https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6120.html#stanzas-error-syntax">
        RFC6120 - Stanzas error - Syntax
      </link>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>'error_condition'</tt> MUST be <tt>'policy-violation'</tt>, as

        RFC 6120 - Stanzas error - Defined Stream Error Conditions</link>,
    </li>
    <li>
      the stanza SHOULD contain a <tt>&lt;text&gt;'</tt> element explaining why
      the message was rejected, and this message SHOULD mention the slow mode
      duration so that users can understand why they can't post their message.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Here is an example or error stanza:

  <example caption='Example error stanza'><![CDATA[
<message

      You have to wait 20 seconds between messages. Please try again later.
    </text>
  </error>
</message>
]]></example>
  <p>
    The rejected message MUST NOT be forwarded to other room occupants.
  </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic="Client handling" anchor="client-handling">
  <p>
    When a participant joins a room, the client SHOULD request room information
    as described in section
    "<link url="#client-discovering">Client discovering</link>", and look for the
    <tt>'muc#roominfo_slow_mode_duration'</tt> field.
  </p>
  <p>
    If this field is present, and contains a valid strictly positive integer
    value, the client SHOULD display an information somewhere, to tell users
    that there is a slow mode limitation that applies to this room.
    This information MAY also be displayed to users for which the rate limit
    does not apply (administrators, owners, ...).
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, each time a participant sends a text message, the client SHOULD
    prevent the user to send another message before the timeout is passed.
    This MAY be done either by disabling the input field, or the submit button.
    If the user has at least the administrator acces level, the client
    SHOULD NOT disable the input field or the submit button.
  </p>
  <p>
    To avoid some frustrating behaviour, in case there is some lag on the server
    for example, the client MAY start counting time after receiving the message
    echo. Indeed, if the first message is processed with some delay by the
    server, it could consider that the duration is not passed yet when receiving
    the next one.
  </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <p>
    As a same user can join a room with multiple sessions and/or nicknames,
    the server MUST use the appropriate criteria to identify the account, and
    apply the same limits to all user's sessions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The slow mode duration parameter is a positive integer. When parsing its
    value, clients and servers MUST ignore invalid value.
    They MUST also check that this value is not to big to store in memory
    (this depends on the data type used by the implementation).

      &xep0068; defines a process for standardizing the fields used within Data
      Forms scoped by a particular namespace, and the XMPP Registrar maintains a
      registry of such FORM_TYPES (see &FORMTYPES;).
